# Why we choose this topic:

The relationship between low-carbon electricity usage and global average temperatures is a critical subject in today's world.
Understanding how the use of low-carbon energy sources can affects global temperatures and CO2 emissions associated is very important for 
policymakers, governments, researchers, and the general public. 
This data analysis help to explore this relationship and highlight its significance.

# Project Objective 
The primary objective of this data analysis is to investigate if there is a correlation between first temperature & energy consumption, second, the use of low-carbon electricity sources and global average temperatures across 101 different countries. Additionally, the analysis will examine the emissions of CO2 and their impact on temperatures.

#  Research Questions: 

### there is any correlation between :
###  1 -temperature and energy consumption

###  2 - temperature and low-carbon electricity      
       
###  3- Co2 emissions & renewable energy .


# Data analysis process 

## Data Collection : 

###  - Collect data on low-carbon electricity percentage usage for each of the 101 countries. This data may include the percentage of electricity generated from low carbon  sources like wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power.
###  - Gather data on global average temperatures over a specific time period (year 2019) for these countries.

the first column contain 101 countries sorted by alphabet.
The columns in our dataset are:

```
1. Country
2. Average Temperature in 2019
3. Renewable Energy Share in the Total Final Energy Consumption (%)
4. Electricity from Fossil Fuels (TWh - Terawatt-hours)
5. Electricity from Nuclear (TWh)
6. Electricity from Renewables (TWh)
7. Low-carbon Electricity (% of Electricity)
8. Primary Energy Consumption per Capita (kWh/person)
9. CO2 Emissions (Metric Tons per Capita)
10. Latitude
11. Longitude
12. 2020 Population 
```
## Data Visualizations:

A variety of visualizations, including scatter plots, box plots, linear regression and map plots, were used to explore different aspects of the data. These visualizations enhanced our understanding of the data and provided insights into distribution, correlation, and geographic patterns.

##### Analysis
##### The r-squared is: 0.40616752081275864 so There is a weak correlation between energy consumption and average temperature, after removing outliers.

##### Final Analysis: Based on the data provided, there is a weak correlation between energy consumption and temperature for all countries (outliers removed). The correlation is non-existant when all countries are included in the data. 
However, for countries with an average temperature of 10 or lower, there is a moderate to strong correlation.
# Add TTest 
Do higher and lower temperatures have an impact on energy consumption?
Null Hypothesis: Average country temperatures above 25 degress celsius and below 10 degress celsius have no impact on energy consumption.
Alternative Hypothesis: Average country temperatures above 25 degress celsius and below 10 degress celsius might play a factor in energy consumption.

```
### Result 
```
Ttest_indResult(statistic=-2.2483778025923717, pvalue=0.028435494666494792)
```
### Analysis 
Since the p-value is less than .05, we reject the null hypothesis of the t-test and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to say that temperatures might play an impact on energy consumption.

##### Analysis
##### 1-Linear Regression for Lowest Temperature Countries: Slope (Coefficient) = -13.9328 so Colder countries tend to rely more heavily on low-carbon electricity sources production but they have a higher percentage of lc production
#####  2-Linear Regression for Highest Temperature Countries: Slope (Coefficient) = 4.6044 so hotter countries in this group demonstrate a evolutif production of low-carbon electricity
#####   3-Linear Regression for All Countries: Slope (Coefficient) = -2.07 so this indicate that as the average temperature increases, the percentage of low-carbon electricity decreases

##### Analysis
##### Analysis : we have a negative coefficient -9.25 so the coldest countries tend to rely more heavily on renewables energy pourcentage  or the highest countries with a strong correlation coefficient 15,58 tend to use more renewable energy source .the percentage of renewable energy used have a positif regression with the average temperature on global countries

# Add TTest 
Develop a TTest to check our Hypotisis 
Null Hypothesis : there is no difference between renewable energy used in the 10 Coldest countries and the 10 hotest country 
Alternative Hypothesis : there is a significant difference between the two groups in term of consumption of renewable energies

```
#ttest code
#define groupes
Hotest_countries = main_data.loc[main_data['Average Temp'] >= 28.70]
coldest_countries = main_data.loc[main_data['Average Temp'] <= 10]

#perform independent two sample t-test
ttest_ind(Hotest_countries['Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%)'], coldest_countries['Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%)'])
```
### Result 
```
Ttest_indResult(statistic=0.3185904666968613, pvalue=0.7533402039975953)
```
### Analysis 
the p-value (0.753) is much larger than 0.05 (a common significance level).so we  do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. we conclude that there is no significant difference between the two groups.

### Final  Analysis

##### The analysis of our results for the top ten countries with the highest and the lowest average temperatures indicates that temperature may indeed play a significant role in influencing the choice of electricity sources in different countries. 
##### The coldest countries, which are happen to be more developed, exhibit the highest usage of low-carbon electricity sources.
##### Colder climates may drive the adoption of low-carbon electricity sources as a more efficient and sustainable option, while hotter regions may also be moving in the same direction. 
##### Additionally, the higher usage of low-carbon electricity in colder, more developed countries highlights the potential correlation between economic development and the adoption of low carbon  energy sources.

#### Analysis
##### The resulting plot will show a bar chart with each country's name on the x-axis and the corresponding CO2 emissions per capita (expressed as "low-carbon electricity (% electricity)") on the y-axis. 
##### Each bar will represent a country, and its height will indicate the value of CO2 emissions per capita. The blue color is used to distinguish the bars.
##### This chart should help visualize and compare the low CO2 emission countries in terms of their CO2 emissions per capita,allowing for easy identification of which countries have lower emissions in relation to their electricity production.

#### Analysis
##### We have a correlation between low CO2 emissions and higher use of renewable energy, The countries that produce more renewable energy generate less CO2 .it's essential to remember that each country's energy mix and emissions profile are influenced by unique factors, including geography, natural resources, economic conditions, and government policies.If the average low-carbon electricity percentage is higher for countries with "Low CO2 Emissions," it would suggest that these countries tend to use more low-carbon electricity sources.

# Summary:

The final analysis about our primary objective :

## 1 - Temperature & energy consumption
There is a strong correlation between Temperature and energy consumption in countries with an average temperature of 10 degrees or less. Overall, there is a weak correlation. 
## 2 - Temperature &  the low-carbon electricity sources 
The Coldest countries tend to generate a greater proportion of low-carbon electricity compared to their warmer countries with some exceptions.
## 3 - Co2 Emission & renewable energy produced
The countries that produce more renewable energy generate less Co2 .
