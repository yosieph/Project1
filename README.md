# Team Members: Danik Lafrance, Khadija Fahr, Yosieph Fissuh


# Why we choose this topic:

The relationship between low-carbon electricity usage and global average temperatures is a critical subject in today's world.
Understanding how the use of low-carbon energy sources can affects global temperatures and CO2 emissions associated is very important for 
policymakers, governments, researchers, and the general public. 
This data analysis help to explore this relationship and highlight its significance.

# Project Objective 
The primary objective of this data analysis is to investigate if there is a correlation between first Temperature & energy consumption ,second the use of low-carbon electricity sources and global average temperatures across 101 different countries. 
Additionally, the analysis will examine the emissions of CO2 and their impact on temperatures.

# Data analysis process 


## Data Collection : 

###  - Collect data on low-carbon electricity percentage usage for each of the 101 countries. This data may include the percentage of electricity generated from low carbon  sources like wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power.
###    - Gather data on global average temperatures over a specific time period (year 2019) for these countries.
###  - Collect data on emissions related to the use of energy ,  CO2 emissions .
###  - Collect the Longitude and latitude value of differents countries to make a good map

##### Analysis
##### the coldest country are Iceland, canada,finland and others  are all Iceland, and the uses of Low carbon electricity pourcentage is very hight above belarus and estonia ,irland 
The highest countries are Sudan ,Niger ,Djibouti and others dont have high carbon electricity pourcentage except Sudan with 63.3% and Cambodia with 53.37% and little be for Mali with 35.24% 
If we have a global look at  the result we can definitely see that the lowest countries use more low carbon electricity than the highest countries except Sudan and Cambodia , so we can add more factors like a development , richness or others in our analysis to be more credible .

##### Analysis
##### Linear Regression for All Countries: Slope (Coefficient) = -2.07 so this indicate that as the average temperature increases, the percentage of low-carbon electricity decreases





### Final  Analysis

##### The analysis of our results for the top ten countries with the highest and the lowest average temperatures indicates that temperature may indeed play a significant role in influencing the choice of electricity sources in different countries. 
The coldest countries, which are happen to be more developed, exhibit the highest usage of low-carbon electricity sources.
Colder climates may drive the adoption of low-carbon electricity sources as a more efficient and sustainable option, while hotter regions may also be moving in the same direction. 
Additionally, the higher usage of low-carbon electricity in colder, more developed countries highlights the potential correlation between economic development and the adoption of low carbon  energy sources.

#  Conclusion

### This data analysis sheds light on the complex interplay between temperature, energy consumption, low-carbon electricity usage and Co2 emission. 
Understanding these dynamics is crucial for addressing climate change, optimizing energy resources, and making informed decisions regarding energy policy and sustainability initiatives. 
Further research and investigation into specific regions and policy interventions may be necessary to develop targeted strategies for reducing carbon emissions and promoting clean energy adoption.


#  Recommendations 
our recommendations or insights for future research in this area are :
1 -Exploration of Other Factors:
- Further analysis considered additional factors like population and economic indicators, energy consumption over the years, revealing potential relationships between these variables and energy consumption.
Those relationships may offer insights into energy demand patterns and the adoption of low-carbon energy sources and gives more valuable information  for policymakers and energy planners as they prepare for future energy needs.
